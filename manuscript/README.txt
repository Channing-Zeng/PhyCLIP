Data is structured by section.
For the tree files, the clustering results are annotated and accessible under "tip label" as "CLUSTER" if FigTree is used for data visualisation.
All code and data files are either up on GitHub or available from authors on request -- ep484@cam.ac.uk or hanxc@bii.a-star.edu.sg
