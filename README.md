# PhyCLIP (_Phylogenetic Clustering by Linear Integer Programming_)

## Overview

PhyCLIP is an integer linear programming (ILP) approach that optimally delineates a tree into statistically-principled clusters. Other than a **_rooted_** phylogeny, 3 additional inputs are required from the user: 
1. Minimum number of sequences (_S_) that can be quantified as a cluster.
2. Multiple of deviations (_gamma_) from the grand median of the mean pairwise sequence patristic distance that defines the within-cluster divergence limit. 
3. False discovery rate (_FDR_) to infer that the diversity observed for every combinatorial pair of output clusters is significantly distinct from one another.
